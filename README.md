## Comments 

Here it is, another thing I should, but will never use. A note taker. Besides the delete, which I still can not get, the hardest "required" part of this was figuring out how and where to place the files. Do I create a server.js? Do I need a folder for routes and one for the HTML and one for the APIs. And that is what I did. 

I used Node.js express, to create the server, and the APIs. Then used uuid package to create a unique id for each note. 


## Technologies
- Node.js
- npm
    - express
    - uuid
